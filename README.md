# Blobchain
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/AsherFoster/blobchain.svg?branch=images)](https://travis-ci.com/AsherFoster/blobchain)
Blobchain is a random community driven experiment. Ever commit added to the repository modifies
the image created by the last. These changes chain over time, creating a recursive image defined
by the process each commit applies

## Contributing
Go ahead and submit a PR!

I'd suggest editing `blobchain/process.py` to add your own transformation to the image, but I'll be
accepting as many PRs as possible.

## Future features
- Testing
- Automatic PRs
- Sentience
